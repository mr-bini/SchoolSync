# SchoolSync
SchoolSync is a web-based platform designed to help high school students:
Organize study groups.
Track homework and deadlines.
Share notes with classmates.
Play fun quizzes and challenges.
Itâ€™s built for everyday school life, where students often forget assignments, need study buddies, or want light-hearted competitions. Unlike university-level systems, it avoids heavy admin features and keeps things simple, social, and fun
